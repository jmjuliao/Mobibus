We have a pretty typical Cordova style project structure.</p>\n<p>\tIf you look in the <strong>src</strong> folder though (which is where most of your development will occur), things start looking a little bit different:</p>\n<p>\t<img alt=\"Ionic 2 Project Structure\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6131\" height=\"1616\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" src=\"https://www.joshmorony.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2016-10-02-20.18.00.png\" srcset=\"https://www.joshmorony.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2016-10-02-20.18.00.png 420w, https://www.joshmorony.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2016-10-02-20.18.00-78x300.png 78w, https://www.joshmorony.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2016-10-02-20.18.00-266x1024.png 266w\" width=\"420\"></p>\n<p>\tUsually in an Ionic 1 application, people would have all of their Javascript files (controllers, services, etc.) in one folder, all of the templates in another folder, and all of the styling information would usually be contained in a single <strong>app.scss</strong> file.</p>\n<p>\tThe default structure for an Ionic 2 application organises by functionality, so you have all of the logic, templates and styling for a particular component (in the example above we have a basic page component, a list component, and an item details component) in the one spot. This plays in well with the Angular 2 methodology of having everything be standalone components that can easily be reused in other places or projects. If you wanted to reuse a particular feature, or have lots of people working on the same project, the old Ionic 1 approach can become quite troublesome.</p>\n<p>\tThe idea of organising code by feature is not specific to Angular 2 &amp; Ionic 2, in fact people were using and advocating for the feature based approach in Ionic 1 applications, it&rsquo;s just that most people were doing it the other way (trends are hard to break). With the way Angular 2 works though, using the feature based structure is the default and it&rsquo;s pretty hard not to use that structure.</p>\n<p>\tFor more info read: <a href=\"http://www.joshmorony.com/ionic-2-first-look-series-your-first-ionic-2-app-explained/\">Ionic 2 First Look Series: Your First Ionic 2 App Explained</a></p>\n"},{"title": "Typescript","id": "typescript","content": "<p>By default Ionic 2 uses Typescript instead of Javascript, to stay up-to-date with the new way to work with Ionic see this <a href=\"https://www.gitbook.com/book/basarat/typescript/details\" target=\"_blank\">Book</a>.</p>\n"},{"title": "Usage","id": "usage","content": "<ol>\n<li>Install Ionic CLI `npm install -g ionic cordova`.
